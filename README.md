# Penguin-Lamp
Hello! 
I designed this lamp to one of my teacher, as later.. around May I will graduate from my school. I don't think that I would be able to see her again..
She likes penguin. I wanted to design a penguin lamp for her. 
in this project I 3D design a penguin lamp using Fusion360. Then, I wanted to put a LED strip into the 3D printed penguin
